## Faan Ke pomodoro    
Faan ke is the romanization of tomato in Cantonese. 

I am making a pomodoro timer for myself to use with added features I wanted. Chiefly, I wanted little pics of tomatoes accumulating when I completed a pomodoro, and I wanted to try setting up a calendar that shows tallies of my pomodoros saved in the browser's local storage.

I'm writing all of this up from scratch with HTML5/CSS and JS to cement my understanding of DOM manipulation.

## To do

- [x] visual mockup
- [x] timer functionality
- [x] responsive design
- [x] tomato pics and favicons
- [x] clear pomodoro pictures
- [x] about page
- [x] log pomodoro time start and end in localStorage
- [x] clear pomodoro logs
- [ ] calendar of pomodoro tally
